 It contains 3 Projects

 Hahn.ApplicatonProcess.May2020.Data
 This project is a .Net Standard Class Library containing the models, repositories and their respective implementations.

 This Class library contains all the requirement for data entry

 The domain contains the application services, these service essentially relate with the ready made repositories and serve as the decision making engine.

 It visualises the application engine in the form of restful endpoints
